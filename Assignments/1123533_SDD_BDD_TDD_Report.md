## 1. Introduction
 In the current age of software development and computer science, artificial intelligence is gradually being involved in the software engineering process. With AI Assistance in Software Development, code generation, documentation, test cases, and other software artifacts can be done more swiftly and efficiently. As advancements in AI technology continue, they are gradually become a vital tool in modern software development workflows. One could even say that AI is slowly dominating every aspect of the tech industry. To organize development workflow and ensure efficiency and coherence, certain methods or approaches have been conceptualized. The three specific methods are SDD, BDD, and TDD.

 There are cases where AI does not automatically understand the developer's exact intentions or project requirements. Without clear instructions plus well-defined objectives, AI-generated results can be inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent with the desired outcome. Therefore, developers must provide precise requirements, expected behaviors, and validation criteria to effectively guide AI-assisted development.

 This is where Software Design Description, Behavior-Driven Development, and Test-Driven Development become helpful. SDD helps define the system's requirements and specifications, BDD describes how the system should behave from a user's point of view, and TDD establishes test cases that verify the system's functionality. Altogether, these approaches help create a structured framework that improves communication, reduces ambiguity, and helps ensure that AI-generated software artifacts align with the intended design and functionality.

## 2. Definition of SDD 
**SDD**, or Specification-Driven Development, is the approach that treats specifications as the ultimate focus in all development aspects. This ranges from architecture design to testing & deployment. By getting requirements defined clearly at the beginning of a project, developers can ensure that the final system meets the intended functionality and business objectives. SDD also helps reduce vagueness and provides a common reference for both developers and AI-assisted development tools.

## 3. SDD: Student Grade Calculator
The Student Grade Calculator computes a student's final score using weighted assessment via components to determine the corresponding letter grade.

### 3.1 Goal
The Student Grade Calculator's main purpose is to determine a student's final score using weighted assessment via 4 components and determines the corresponding letter grade according to predefined rules for grading. The system shall output the final score rounded to one decimal place and display the appropriate letter grade.

### 3.2 Functional Requirements
**FR-1: Calculate Final Score** \
The overall grade is determined by the weighted average formula below: \
**Final Score = (Assignment * 0.30) + (Midterm * 0.20) + (Finals * 0.30) + (Project * 0.20)** \
**FR-2: Round Final Score** \
The system shall round the final score to one decimal place before displaying the result. \
**FR-3: Assign Letter Grade** \
The system shall assign a letter grade based on the rounded final score according to the grading rules. \
**FR-4: Validate Input** \
The system shall only accept numeric scores between 0 to 100 for all assessment components. \

### 3.3 Input
The following inputs are accepted by the system:
|Component|Range|Weight|
| ------- |-----|------|
|Assignment|0-100| 30% |
|Midterm   |0-100| 20% |
|Final     |0-100| 30% |
|Project   |0-100| 20% |
All inputs must be numeric values within the range.

### 3.4 Output
The system shall display: \
**1.** Final Score (rounded to one decimal) \
**2.** Letter Grade
Example Output: \
Final Score: **84.2** \
Letter Grade: **B**

### 3.5 Grade Rules
**Grade Determination Rules**
|Final Score|Letter Grade|
|-----------|------------|
|90 < Score < 100 | A |
|80 < Score < 90  | B |
|70 < Score < 80  | C |
|60 < Score < 70  | D |
|Score < 60       | F |

### 3.6 Acceptance Criteria
**AC-1: Correct Score Calculation**
|Assignment|Midterm|Finals|Project|Final Score|Grade|
| ------- |-----|------|----------|-----------|-----|
|    82   |   76   |  88  |   90  |   84.2    |  B  |

**Given:** that Assignment = 82, Midterms = 76, Final Exams, 88, and Project = 90. \
When the system computes the final score, \
**then** the result shall be **84.2**.\
And the assigned grade will be **B**.

**AC-2: Grade Boundary Verification**
**Given:** a final score of 90. \
When the final grade is determined, then the assigned grade shall be **A**.

**AC-3: Input Validation**
Given a project score of = 105. \
When the user submits the scores, \
Then the system shall **reject** the input. \
And displays an error message informing that scores must be between 0 to 100.

## 4. Definition of BDD
The Behavior-Driven Development is an approach in software development that uses the user's perspective through natural language to describe system behavior. Scenarios belong to this category are usually written in the Given-When-Then format to specify conditions, actions, and expected results of a system.

## 5. BDD: Student Grade Calculator

### 1. Scenario 1: Student receives the B grade
**Given** the assignment is 84 \
And the Midterm score is 78 \
And the Final Score is 88 \
And the Project Score is 85 \
**When** the system calculates the final grade \
**Then** the final score should be 84.0 
And the Letter Grade should be B. 

### 2. Scenario 2: Invalid project score entered
**Given** the assignment score is 75, \
And the Midterm score is 80 \
And the Final Score is 82 \
And the Project Score is 125 \
**When** the system validates the input scores \
**Then** the system should reject the input 
And an error message should indicate that scores must be between 0 and 100. 

## 6. Definition of TDD
Test-Driven Development involves several test cases, usually 3 of them. Its process is basically writing test case/s that fail, then writing more code to the point that it's enough to pass the test, and lastly improving the code quality without drastic changes to its behavior. This process is usually described as "Red, Green, Refactor". This method helps developers detect defects early on and ensures that the software continuously satisfies its requirements.

## 9. Reflection

After learning about SDD, BDD, and TDD, I found that TDD is the easiest approach for me to understand. As an IT student, I am already familiar with testing programs by providing inputs and checking whether the outputs are correct. TDD follows a similar mindset since it focuses on defining test cases before implementation. By thinking about expected results first, it becomes easier to identify errors and verify that a system behaves as intended.

When it comes to working with AI coding tools, I believe SDD is the most useful approach because it provides clear requirements and specifications. AI can generate code very quickly, but the quality of the generated result depends heavily on the instructions it receives. If requirements are vague, the AI may make assumptions that do not match the developer's intentions. A well-written SDD reduces ambiguity by clearly describing the system goals, inputs, outputs, and functional requirements.

SDD can help reduce unclear AI prompts by giving developers a structured way to define what the software should do. Instead of asking AI to "create a grade calculator," a developer can provide detailed requirements such as grading rules, calculation formulas, and validation constraints. This allows the AI to generate results that are closer to the expected solution.

BDD is useful because it describes software behavior from a user's perspective. The Given–When–Then format makes requirements easier to understand and communicate. Rather than focusing on technical implementation details, BDD focuses on how users expect the system to behave in different situations. This can help AI tools understand the intended functionality and can also improve communication among developers, testers, and stakeholders.

TDD helps verify whether AI-generated code is correct by providing predefined test cases. Even if AI generates code that appears correct, it may still contain logical errors or fail in special situations. By running normal, boundary, and invalid-input test cases, developers can confirm whether the generated solution satisfies the requirements.

In future software dev. projects, I would combine all three approaches. I would start with SDD to define requirements and guide AI-generated outputs. Next, I would use BDD to describe user expectations and important system behaviors. Finally, I would apply TDD to create test cases and verify that the generated code works correctly. Using these three approaches together would provide a structured process for guiding, evaluating, and improving AI-assisted software development.
